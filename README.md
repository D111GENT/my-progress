###### One of the best ways to stay motivated is to know how far you've come.

✔ Deployed my first [smart contract](https://github.com/D111GENT/my-progress/blob/main/SimpleStorage.sol)

✔ Set up hardhat and explore: [repo](https://github.com/D111GENT/exploring-hardhat)

✔ Learned about the [JSON-RPC Spec](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-apis/api-documentation/)

✔ Set up an environment in [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to start bug testing [pillar contracts](https://github.com/pillarwallet/pillar-dao-contracts) as part of their [bug bounty program](https://immunefi.com/bounty/pillar/)

✔ Set up environment to learn [Etherspot SDK](https://etherspot.io/) to create an [Etherspot Demo App](https://github.com/pillarwallet/pillarwallet/blob/develop/RECRUITMENT.md) and showcase my abilities
